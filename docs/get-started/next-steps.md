## Where to next?

You should now have a grasp of the basic building blocks of Cowait. Of course, you have only scratched the surface. We recommend you read through the [Setup](/docs/setup/configuration) section where you will learn more about setting up Cowait.

Some logical next steps after that:

1. Look at some example tasks at [github](https://github.com/backtick-se/cowait/tree/master/examples)
2. Learn how to run your tasks on [Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes/setup/)
3. Learn more about Cowait's [type system](/docs/tasks/type-system/)
4. Learn how to communicate between your tasks using [RPC](/docs/tasks/remote-procedure-calls/)
5. Learn how to run background tasks in [jupyter notebooks](/docs/extras/notebook-integration/)
6. Look at some [built in tasks](/docs/tasks/built-in-tasks/).
